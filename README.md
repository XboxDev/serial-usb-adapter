# Original Xbox Serial USB Adapter

### Overview

This device allows for serial communication with an original Xbox and is primarily used for kernel debugging.

### Requirements

##### Hardware

Any original Xbox of any version (although versions 1.3-1.5 require LFRAME# reconnect and version 1.6 requires full LPC port rebuild, including LFRAME#).
Debug and development kits will work without modification, however, retail boxes need to use a hacked kernel (X2 5035 or iND 5004 for example) that initializes superio as well as have a 2x8 2.54mm pin header soldered to the LPC port.

##### Software

A Windows OS capable of running WinDbg; versions 4.0.0018.0 (XDK) or [6.12.0002.633](http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/6/A/A6AC035D-DA3F-4F0C-ADA4-37C8E5D34E3D/setup/WinSDKDebuggingTools/dbg_x86.msi) have been tested successfully.

[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/) to work with the project files if needed.

### Usage

Connect a micro USB cable from your PC to the serial adapter, then the IDC cable ends into the serial adapter and Xbox LPC port pin headers respectively, ensuring the correct alignment and orientation as shown in the image above. **Incorrect orientation may result in damage to the adapter and/or your Xbox, you have been warned!**

Within WinDbg press `CTRL+K` to bring up the connection dialog and enter `115200` for the baud rate along with the `COM#` port as detected by your computer in device manager.

`CTRL+Break` can be used to pause execution, `F5` to continue, and `F10/F11` to step over or through instructions.
`CTRL+ALT+D` will toggle verbose windbg protocol output for troubleshooting if needed.
The adapter's blue RX LED indicates signals sent from the PC and the green TX LED from the Xbox.

### Components

Bold designators are the bare minimum required for basic functionality but stability may be questionable. The entire UART to USB circuit and/or LED output is optional and can be replaced with an external 3.3V UART to USB cable jumpered to J2 instead.
